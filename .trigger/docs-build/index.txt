Media Playback
iOS Safari disables autoplayback, and launches a full-screen widget when playing video. 


inline video - set this to TRUE to disable fullscreen playback. The &lt;video&gt; element in the HTML document must also include the 'webkit-playsinline' attribute.


require user action - set this to FALSE to allow auto play. Ensure the &lt;audio&gt; or &lt;video&gt; element you want to play has the 'autoplay' attribute set.
